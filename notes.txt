Big Topics:
- Rendering Engine


- Some way to insert game into engine
- Better scratchpad/sandbox support
- Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
- Some way to separate game and engine data
- Add higher level rendering constructs
    (Shaders, Materials, Transforms, Meshes)
    Avoid managing low-level rendering.
- Add some form of automatic shader selection
- Add some form of primitives
    (Rectangles, spheres, triangles)
- More flexible transform class
    We shouldn't need to set up: perspective projection, camera
- Non-perspective views: (orthogonal views)
- Texture manipulation (Translation, rotation, scale)
